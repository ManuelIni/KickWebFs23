                    USTREQ, short for Custom
                    Requester, is a glorified Ask
                    command for your startup-
                    sequence.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">The program is best placed in
                    your C: directory. It has a very long
                    command line, requiring four compulsory parameters, plus another
                    four optional ones.

                    startup-sequence. Ed will do the
                    job if you have nothing else. See
                    the usage box for the command

                        This month's tune is a brilliant
                        rendition of two intermingled space
                        fantasy themes. The first is a well
                        known march as you have never
                        heard it before, The second I seem
                        to recognise as the theme from an
                        epic film. Anyone know its proper
                        title?
